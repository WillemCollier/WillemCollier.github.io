Hello! Thank you for visiting my page. I am a 5th year PhD candidate in the biostatistics track of the Population Health Sciences Program at the University of Utah. I currently work with Dr. Tom Greene on research revolving around statistical methods for the evaluation and use of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. My primary research interests involve surrogate endpoint validation, novel clinical trial design, meta-analysis, and broadly, Bayesian statistics, with emphasis in Bayesian hierarchical models. I am also interested in causal inference and the theory and methods that help bridge the gap between association and causation. Finally, I am fortunate to have had rich collaborative experiences with a variety of medical and surgical Divisions throughout my time as a PhD student and enjoy gaining knowledge in science and medicine through collaboration. I am on track to graduate in Spring 2022 and look forward to advancing my methodological and collaborative research. I have additional information available in the tabs above, but please also feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
