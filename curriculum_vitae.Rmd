### Additional Comments

I hope to always work in and contribute as a member of a thriving research and education community. I strive to be engaged with and be helpful to my fellow students as well as the Department or research group I work closely with. 

As an undergraduate student, I tutored math and engineering students to not only provide help with subject material, but also with navigating the program to achieve their broader goals. I hold multiple committee positions, including the Graduate Student Advisory Committee, the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion - Community Engagement Committee, and recently the Faculty Promotion and Retention Committee as the student representative. I also help the Department with student recruitment by attending and talking through my experiences in open houses and meet and greets. I meet with students to share my experiences and potentially ease logistics for challenging processes such as qualifying exams. I am also working with a fellow student to establish a monthly journal club for the biostatistics students. Finally, I believe that being engaged as a researcher requires frequently communicating ongoing research efforts not only beyond but within an institution. While I was funded by the Division of Plastic Surgery, I presented on multiple occasions at Division research meetings and at the Department of Surgery's U-INQUIRE research meeting. More recently, I have presented twice to the National Kidney Foundation at the twice-annual CKD-EPI Webinar. As I move forward with my career, I plan to put equal weight on written and oral communication of research. I will generally do whatever I can to support an engaged and enjoyable work community.
