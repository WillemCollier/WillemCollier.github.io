I spent most of my childhood dreaming of being a professional skier until I discovered my interests in statistics and biomedical research. I still value being active and utilize available free time time by cycling and running, and have had the privilege of racing some of the West’s great endurance cross country mountain bike and gravel races over the last few years. My wife is an MD student at the University of Utah and we are both looking forward to graduating in Spring 2022 to find the next place to think hard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I strive to be engaged with and be helpful to my fellow students as well as the Department or research group I work closely with.\r\nAs an undergraduate student, I tutored math and engineering students to not only provide help with subject material, but also with navigating the program to achieve their broader goals. I hold multiple committee positions, including the Graduate Student Advisory Committee, the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion - Community Engagement Committee, and recently the Faculty Promotion and Retention Committee as the student representative. I also help the Department with student recruitment by attending and talking through my experiences in open houses and meet and greets. I meet with students to share my experiences and potentially ease logistics for challenging processes such as qualifying exams. I am also working with a fellow student to establish a monthly journal club for the biostatistics students. Finally, I believe that being engaged as a researcher requires frequently communicating ongoing research efforts not only beyond but within an institution. While I was funded by the Division of Plastic Surgery, I presented on multiple occasions at Division research meetings and at the Department of Surgery’s U-INQUIRE research meeting. More recently, I have presented twice to the National Kidney Foundation at the twice-annual CKD-EPI Webinar. As I move forward with my career, I plan to put equal weight on written and oral communication of research. I will generally do whatever I can to support an engaged and enjoyable work community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello! Thank you for visiting my page. I am a 5th year PhD candidate in the biostatistics track of the Population Health Sciences Program at the University of Utah. I currently work with Dr. Tom Greene on research revolving around statistical methods for the evaluation and use of surrogate endpoints in clinical trials. My primary research interests involve surrogate endpoint validation, novel clinical trial design, meta-analysis, and broadly, Bayesian statistics, with emphasis in Bayesian hierarchical models. I am also interested in causal inference and the theory and methods that help bridge the gap between association and causation. Finally, I am fortunate to have had rich collaborative experiences with a variety of medical and surgical Divisions throughout my time as a PhD student and enjoy gaining knowledge in science and medicine through collaboration. I am on track to graduate in Spring 2022 and look forward to advancing my methodological and collaborative research. I have additional information available in the tabs above, but please also feel free to contact me if you have any questions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nBackground\r\nI began my time as an undergraduate student in the social sciences. It was through my economics degree that I discovered enthusiasm for quantitative research methods and started taking math courses. I deeply enjoyed Utah’s math coursework and community, and decided to also complete the math degree with emphasis in statistics. While a math student, I did some research in probability theory (see 2017), but wanted to work on applied problems tied to medicine and health care. I gravitated towards biostatistics and chose to continue my education in Utah. I was partially funded by the Division of Plastic Surgery and was also awarded the Mariner S. Eccles Fellowship for related work during my first two years as a PhD student. I helped Plastic Surgery faculty design, analyze, and write manuscripts for observational surgical outcomes research projects. I have also received support through the Study Design and Biostatistics Center (SDBC) and collaborated with Pediatrics, Orthopedics, and a palliative care team at the Huntsman Cancer Institute. I am now advised by Dr. Tom Greene as my dissertation committee chair, where we work with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) on research related to the evaluation and application of candidate surrogate endpoints in chronic kidney diseases (CKD). Along with Dr. Greene, I also work especially closely with Dr. Ben Haaland, Dr. Hiddo Heerspink, and Dr. Lesley Inker. I hope to move forward with my career by equally emphasizing statistical methodological research and applied and collaborative research.\r\nDisseration Overview\r\nI have three dissertation projects either recently submitted or for which manuscripts are being prepared. Here is a brief overview of the three projects:\r\nI am extending a trial-level Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression approach to surrogate endpoint evaluation to allow variability in the quality of the surrogate across pre-specified subgroups of trials.\r\nA key data input for the trial-level meta-regression evaluation of a surrogate endpoint is commonly treated as a nuisance parameter or is fixed to an arbitrary value because it is difficult to estimate and not often of primary interest. I show mathematically and through a simulation study that this term can drive the interpreted quality of the surrogate and provide a Bayesian modeling strategy to handle this term when it is partially missing.\r\nI am working on a sample-size and endpoint adaptive Bayesian clinical trial design for CKD trials, where a combination of multiple surrogate endpoints and/or the established clinical endpoint are used at interim analyses for go/no-go decisions and the choice of final endpoint.\r\nHighlights: Bayesian hierarchical models and meta-regression, surrogate endpoint evaluation, novel Bayesian adaptive clinical trial design.\r\nOther Interests\r\nMuch of my early PhD coursework emphasized causal inference, both theory and methods. I believe it is critically important to align the study design and statistical analysis with subject expertise such that all members of a study team understand the assumptions necessary to bridge the gap between an association interpretation and a causal one. Ideally, a study should be designed to create potential for a causal conclusion, even if strong causal assumptions cannot be verified. I plan to stay current with my working knowledge of causal theory and methods throughout my career, and I intend to continue to apply causal thinking and methods in collaborative work, where appropriate. For example, when the goal of a project is to understand the relationship between a primary exposure and outcome, I am interested in using graphical methods with collaborators to identify key confounders of the primary relationship of interest. I am also intrigued by using propensity score-based methods to analyze exposure-outcome relationships for later ease of interpretation.\r\nCollaborative Publications\r\nPublished Peer-Reviewed Publications\r\nVan Boerum MS, Mann SL, Veith JP, Collier W, Hosein RC, Manum JS, Agarwal J, Kwok AC.
