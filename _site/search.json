I was born in New England, but grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah. I spent most of my childhood dreaming of being a professional skier until I started to value my bone, joint, and brain-health. I now spend most of my recreation time time cycling and running, when work allows. My wife is an MD student at the University of Utah and we are both looking forward to graduating in Spring 2022 to find the next place to think hard!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nPlease find my full CV here.\r\nAdditional Tidbits\r\nI’ve always felt I work best when I am a part of a thriving community. Throughout undergraduate and PhD programs, I’ve worked to keep engaged with and be helpful to my fellow students as well as the Department or research group I work closely with.\r\nAs an undergraduate student, I tutored math and engineering students to not only help with subject material, but also with navigating the program to achieve their broader goals. I have held multiple committee positions throughout my PhD program, including the Graduate Student Advisory Committee, the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion - Community Engagement Committee, and recently the Faculty Promotion and Retention Committee as the student representative. I also help the Department with student recruitment by attending and talking through my experiences in open houses and meet and greets. I meet frequently with current students to help ease the logistics of difficult processes like the Department’s qualifying exam. I am also working to establish a monthly journal club for the biostatistics students in the PHS program. Finally, I believe that being engaged as a researcher requires frequently communicating ongoing research efforts both within and beyond the institution. While I was funded by the Division of Plastic Surgery, I presented on multiple occasions at Division research meetings and at the Department of Surgery’s U-INQUIRE research meeting. More recently, I have presented twice to the National Kidney Foundation at the twice-annual CKD-EPI Webinar. As I move forward with my career, I hope to put equal weight on written and oral communication of research. I also hope to do whatever I possibly can to help students and colleagues not only make the most of their research but enjoy it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I am a 5th year PhD candidate in the biostatistics track of the Population Health Sciences Program at the University of Utah. My current research efforts revolve around statistical methods for the evaluation and use of surrogate endpoints for clinical trials. I have also had the fortune of collaborating extensively with a variety of medical and surgical divisions while a graduate student. I am on track to graduate in Spring 2022 and look forward to starting a new statistical adventure. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nMy Research Journey\r\nI began my time as an undergraduate student in the social sciences. It was through my economics degree that I discovered an enthusiasm for quantitative research methods, and I began taking math courses in my fourth undergraduate year. I deeply enjoyed the math coursework and community, and decided to complete the math degree with emphasis in statistics. While a math student, I did some research in probability theory (see 2017), but wanted to work on applied problems with potential impact in medicine and health care. Naturally, I gravitated towards biostatistics and chose to continue my education in Utah. I was partially funded by the Division of Plastic Surgery as well as by the Mariner S. Eccles Fellowship during my first two years as a PhD student. I helped Plastic Surgery design, analyze, and write manuscripts for observational surgical outcomes research projects. I was also partially funded by the Study Design and Biostatistics Center (SDBC), where I collaborated with Pediatrics, Orthopedics, and a palliateive care team at the Huntsman Cancer Institute. During years 4 and 5 of my PhD program, I have been funded by the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) to work on research related to the evaluation and application of candidate surrogate endpoints in chronic kidney disease (CKD). I hope to move forward with my career by equally emphasizing statistical methodological research and applied and collaborative research. One of the most exciting aspects of biostatistics is being able to continuously learn more about math and statistics while also developing knowledge about science and medicine through collaboration.\r\nDisseration Overview\r\nI have three dissertation projects at various stages (one submitted, second in manuscript preparation, and third in an early-simulation phase). Here is a brief overview of the three projects:\r\nWe are extending a trial-level Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression approach to surrogate endpoint evaluation to allow variability in the quality of the surrogate across pre-specified subgroups of trials.\r\nA key data input for the trial-level meta-regression evaluation of a surrogate endpoint is commonly treated as a nuisance parameter or is fixed to an arbitrary value because it is difficult to estimate and not often of primary interest. We show mathematically and through a simulation study that this term can drive the interpreted quality of the surrogate by biasing key meta-regression terms, and we provide a Bayesian modeling strategy to handle this term when it is partially missing in available meta-data.\r\nI am working on a sample-size and endpoint adaptive Bayesian clinical trial design for CKD trials, where a combination of multiple surrogate endpoints and/or the established clinical endpoint are used at interim analyses for go/no-go decisions and the choice of final endpoint.\r\nHighlights: Bayesian hierarchical models and meta-regression, surrogate endpoint evaluation, novel adaptive clinical trial design strategies.\r\nOther Interests\r\nMuch of my early PhD coursework emphasized modern causal inference. I try to emphasize causal theory in the design of the statistical analysis plan in much of my collaborative work, especially when the goal is to estimate the effect of a primary exposure of interest on a clinically relevant outcome. I believe it is critically important to align the study design and statistical analysis with subject expertise such that all members of the study team understand the assumptions necessary to bridge the gap between an association interpretation and a causal one. Ideally, a study should be designed to create potential for a causal conclusion, even if strong causal assumptions cannot be verified. I plan to stay current with my working knowledge of causal theory and methods throughout my career, and I intend to continue to apply causal thinking and methods in collaborative work, where appropriate.\r\nCollaborative Publications\r\nPeer-Reviewed Publications\r\nVan Boerum MS, Mann SL, Veith JP, Collier W, Hosein RC, Manum JS, Agarwal J, Kwok AC.
