I am, of course, an aspiring PhD biostatistician, but I am also a partner to Sara Mann, a dog-dad, sports enthusiast, and hopefully a good friend and neighbor. I was born in New England, but grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah. I spent most of my childhood dreaming of being a professional skier until I started to value my bone, joint, and brain-health. I now spend most of my recreation time time cycling and running, when work allows. My wife is an MD student at the University of Utah and we are both looking forward to graduating in Spring 2022 to find the next place to think hard!
