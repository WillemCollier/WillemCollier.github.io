I was born in New England, but grew up in Salt Lake City, Utah. I spent most of my childhood dreaming of being a professional skier until I discovered my interests in statistics and biomedical research. I still value being active and utilize available free time time by cycling and running, and have had the privilege of racing some of the West's great endurance cross country mountain bike and gravel races over the last few years. My wife is an MD student at the University of Utah and we are both looking forward to graduating in Spring 2022 to find the next place to think hard!
